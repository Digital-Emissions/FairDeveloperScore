# Developer Contribution Assessment Report

## Assessment Overview

Based on the analysis of 394 developers' data, we have established a multi-dimensional contribution assessment system that comprehensively evaluates developer contributions from various dimensions: **Quantity**, **Quality** and **Efficiency**.

## 🎯 Assessment Dimensions

### 1. Quantity Dimension (Quantity Metrics)
- **Commit Count** (commit_count): Directly reflects code contribution volume
- **PR Count** (total_prs): Reflects code review and collaboration contributions
- **Active Days** (active_days): Reflects project participation continuity

### 2. Quality Dimension (Quality Metrics)
- **PR Acceptance Rate** (pr_acceptance_rate): Reflects code quality
- **Average Commit Message Length** (avg_msg_len): Reflects code documentation quality
- **Code Change Quality** (avg_total_changes): Reflects reasonableness of code changes

### 3. Efficiency Dimension (Efficiency Metrics)
- **Efficiency Score**: (Average Changes × PR Acceptance Rate) / Active Days
- **Unit Time Contribution**: High-quality output in limited time

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Highly Uneven Contribution Distribution
- **94.2%** of developers belong to low contribution levels
- Only **0.3%** of developers reach very high contribution levels
- Conforms to typical distribution characteristics of open source projects

### 2. Quality vs Quantity Trade-off
- High-quality contributors (PR acceptance rate >90%): **116 developers**
- High-volume contributors (commit count >90% percentile): **32 developers**
- Low overlap between the two, indicating that quality and quantity are often mutually exclusive

### 3. Project Dependency Analysis
- Core contributors account for only **3.6%** but contribute most of the value
- New contributors account for **44.9%**, showing the project's appeal to newcomers

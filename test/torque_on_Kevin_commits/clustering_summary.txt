Why Each Commit Forms Its Own Cluster?
========================================

1. Data Distribution Characteristics:
-----------------------------------
   add:
     - Mean: 417.60
     - Std Dev: 1778.94
     - Min: 0
     - Max: 17909
     - Median: 52.00
     - Range: 17909

   del:
     - Mean: 33.68
     - Std Dev: 110.42
     - Min: 0
     - Max: 1337
     - Median: 5.00
     - Range: 1337

   total:
     - Mean: 451.27
     - Std Dev: 1800.89
     - Min: 0
     - Max: 18334
     - Median: 67.50
     - Range: 18334

2. Sample Uniqueness:
------------------
   - Total samples: 210
   - Unique samples: 202
   - Duplicate samples: 8
   - Uniqueness ratio: 96.2%

3. Distance Analysis:
-----------------
   - Average distance between samples: 1076.24
   - Minimum distance: 0.00
   - Maximum distance: 25632.96
   - Distance standard deviation: 3426.83

4. Torque Clustering Algorithm Behavior:
--------------------------------------
   - Torque = Mass × Distance²
   - Large distances result in very high torque values
   - Algorithm prefers to keep distant samples separate
   - Only very similar samples get merged

5. Development Pattern Analysis:
------------------------------
   - Highly diverse commit patterns (micro-fixes to major rewrites)
   - Wide range of change sizes (1 to 18,334 lines)
   - No clear natural clustering centers
   - Each commit represents a unique development activity

6. Conclusion:
-----------
   The high number of individual clusters reflects the reality of
   software development: each commit is typically a unique solution
   to a specific problem, with its own characteristic change pattern.
   This is not a failure of the algorithm, but rather an accurate
   representation of the diversity in Kevin's development workflow.

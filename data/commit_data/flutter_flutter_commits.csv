Some nodes such as Calendar Date Picker's chevron left and right icons to change months do not announce the text because the only meaningful semantic information is the tooltip. On platforms other than Android, ""Button, Next Month"" is properly announced. On Android, this is not announced on the focus event.

This PR adds `SemanticsLabelBuilder`, a new utility class for creating accessible concatenated labels with proper text direction handling and spacing. Currently, developers manually concatenate semantic labels using string interpolation, which is error-prone and leads to accessibility issues like missing spaces, incorrect text direction for RTL languages. The new builder provides automatic spacing, Unicode bidirectional text embedding for mixed LTR/RTL content.  ### Before (error-prone manual concatenation): ```dart //  Missing space String label = ""$firstName$lastName"";  // ""JohnDoe""  String englishText = ""Welcome"";   String arabicText = ""مرحبا"";     // Arabic ""Hello""  // Manual Concatenation (WITHOUT Unicode embedding): aria-label=""Welcome 欢迎 مرحبا स्वागत है to our global app"" // Problem: Arabic does not have proper text direction handling ```  ### After (automatic and accessible):  Demo app after the change: https://label-0702.web.app/  ```dart // Automatic spacing and text direction handling final label = (SemanticsLabelBuilder()   ..addPart(firstName)   ..addPart(lastName)).build(); // Result: ""John Doe"" with proper aria-label generation  // SemanticsLabelBuilder (WITH Unicode embedding): aria-label=""Welcome 欢迎 [U+202B]مرحبا[U+202C] स्वागत है to our global app"" //  Result: Arabic has proper text direction handling ```  ## Issues Fixed  This fixes https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/162094.   This PR addresses the general accessibility problem of error-prone manual label concatenation that affects screen reader users. While not fixing a specific filed issue, it provides a robust solution for the common pattern of building complex semantic labels that are critical for accessibility compliance, particularly for multilingual applications and complex UI components like contact cards, dashboards, and e-commerce listings.  ## Breaking Changes  No breaking changes were made. This is a purely additive API that doesn't modify existing behavior or require any migration.  ## Key Features Added  - **SemanticsLabelBuilder**: Main builder class for concatenating text parts - **Automatic spacing**: Configurable separators with intelligent empty part handling - **Text direction support**: Unicode bidirectional embedding for RTL/LTR mixed content  ## Example Usage  ```dart // Basic usage final label = (SemanticsLabelBuilder()   ..addPart('Contact')   ..addPart('John Doe')   ..addPart('Phone: +1-555-0123')).build(); // Result: ""Contact John Doe Phone: +1-555-0123""  // Custom separator final label = (SemanticsLabelBuilder(separator: ', ')   ..addPart('Name: Alice')   ..addPart('Status: Online')).build(); // Result: ""Name: Alice, Status: Online""  // Multilingual support final label = (SemanticsLabelBuilder(textDirection: TextDirection.ltr)   ..addPart('Welcome', textDirection: TextDirection.ltr)   ..addPart('مرحبا', textDirection: TextDirection.rtl)   ..addPart('to our app')).build(); // Result: ""Welcome ‫مرحبا‬ to our app"" (with proper RTL embedding) ``` ```  ## Pre-launch Checklist  - [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs. - [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities. - [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement]. - [x] I signed the [CLA]. - [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above. - [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`). - [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt]. - [x] I followed the [breaking change policy] and added [Data Driven Fixes] where supported. - [x] All existing and new tests are passing.  ---------  Co-authored-by: Mouad Debbar <mouad.debbar@gmail.com>",341,0,341

After observing how costly RSuperellipses are on Web, I decided that this is a good compromise.  ## Pre-launch Checklist  - [ ] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs. - [ ] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities. - [ ] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement]. - [ ] I signed the [CLA]. - [ ] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above. - [ ] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`). - [ ] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt]. - [ ] I followed the [breaking change policy] and added [Data Driven Fixes] where supported. - [ ] All existing and new tests are passing.

But there may be other spawned shells that are also using the same IO manager and IO task runner. If the task that calls ReleaseResourceContext runs after the other shells call CreateResourceContext, then the IO thread will be left without an EGL context. That will cause errors in operations like image decoding that need to invoke OpenGL ES APIs on the IO thread.  See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/171213",45,1,46

The file is treated as a new `DevelopmentArtifact.informative` and is fetched before flutterVersion is used. This ensures we have build information for a clean checkout with no bin/cache folder. Users that download from flutter.dev will have engine_stamp.json, so its a no-op.  This change provides support for content hashed engine artifacts, who's revision (the hash) is not a git commit sha. A side benefit is ""git"" is only used at build time to extract this information.  > [!NOTE] > Content hashed artifacts are not enabled yet for downloads; bin/internal/engine.version (releases) and the shell updaters still look for the git commit sha. One can test this out by setting `FLUTTER_PREBUILD_ENGINE_VERSION` to the content hash.",305,13,318

This is effectively equivalent to displaying previews from multiple individual projects, which required a fairly significant rework to properly support:   - resolving asset paths to the right project  - loading assets across projects in the workspace  - tracking changes to pubspec.yaml files across the workspace  While making this change, it became apparent that we don't need to explicitly list the assets from the various projects explicitly in the scaffold's pubspec.yaml as they're automatically pulled in by adding those project's as dependencies and using the `package/$ASSET_PATH` format to load the assets from the scaffold.

For example:  Example feature flags:  1. Android sensitive content: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/158473. When enabled, Flutter will tell Android when the view contains sensitive content like a password. 2. Desktop multi-window. When enabled, Flutter will use child windows to allow things like a context menu to ""escape"" outside of the current window.  ### Use case  Users will be able to turn on features by:  * **Option 1**: Run `flutter config --enable-my-feature`. This enables the feature for all projects on the machine * **Option 2**: Add `enable-my-feature: true` in their `pubspec.yaml`, under the `flutter` section. This would enable the for a single project on the machine.  Turning on a feature affects _both_ development-time (`flutter run`) and deployment-time (`flutter build x`). For example, I can `flutter build windows` to create an `.exe` with multi-window features enabled.  ## How this works  This adds a new [`runtimeId`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168437/files#diff-0ded384225f19a4c34d43c7c11f7cb084ff3db947cfa82d8d52fc94c112bb2a7R243-R247) property to the tool's `Feature` class. If a feature is on and has a `runtimeId`, its `runtimeId` will be [stamped into the Dart application as a Dart define](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168437/files#diff-bd662448bdc2e6f50e47cd3b20b22b41a828561bce65cb4d54ea4f5011cc604eR293-R327). The framework uses this Dart define to [determine which features are enabled](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168437/files#diff-c8dbd5cd3103bc5be53c4ac5be8bdb9bf73e10cd5d8e4ac34e737fd1f8602d45).  ### Multi-window example  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168697 shows how this new feature flag system can be used to add a multi-window feature flag:  1. It adds a new [multi-window feature](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168697/files#diff-0ded384225f19a4c34d43c7c11f7cb084ff3db947cfa82d8d52fc94c112bb2a7R189-R198) to the Flutter tool. This can be turned on using `flutter config --enable-multi-window` or by putting `enable-multi-window: true` in an app's .pubspec, under the `flutter` section. 2. It adds a new [`isMultiWindowEnabled`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168697/files#diff-c8dbd5cd3103bc5be53c4ac5be8bdb9bf73e10cd5d8e4ac34e737fd1f8602d45R7-R11) property to the framework. 3. The Material library can use this new property to determine whether it should create a new window. [Example](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168697/files#diff-2cbc1634ed6b61d61dfa090e7bfbbb7c60b74c8abc3a28df6f79eee691fd1b73).  ## Limitations  ### Tool and framework only  For now, these feature flags are available only to the Flutter tool and Flutter framework. The flags are not automatically available to the embedder or the engine.  For example, embedders need to configure their surfaces differently if Impeller is enabled. This configuration must happen before the Dart isolate is launched. As a result, the framework's feature flags is not a viable solution for this scenario for now. For these kinds of scenarios, we should continue to use platform-specific configuration like the `AndroidManifest.xml` or `Info.plist` files.  This is a fixable limitation, we just need to invest in this plumbing :)  ### Tree shaking  Feature flags are not designed to help tree shaking. For example, you cannot conditionally import Dart code depending on the enabled feature flags.

flutter/flutter,c6f9e801b2e4b324f2f9586d5e40bc4d57ee612b,Loïc Sharma,2025-07-02T17:13:53Z,"Add feature flags to the framework (#168437)  ## Motivation  We'd like to let users opt-in to experimental features so that they can give early feedback while we iterate on the feature. For example:  Example feature flags:  1. Android sensitive content: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/158473. When enabled, Flutter will tell Android when the view contains sensitive content like a password. 2. Desktop multi-window. When enabled, Flutter will use child windows to allow things like a context menu to ""escape"" outside of the current window.  ### Use case  Users will be able to turn on features by:  * **Option 1**: Run `flutter config --enable-my-feature`. This enables the feature for all projects on the machine * **Option 2**: Add `enable-my-feature: true` in their `pubspec.yaml`, under the `flutter` section. This would enable the for a single project on the machine.  Turning on a feature affects _both_ development-time (`flutter run`) and deployment-time (`flutter build x`). For example, I can `flutter build windows` to create an `.exe` with multi-window features enabled.  ## How this works  This adds a new [`runtimeId`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168437/files#diff-0ded384225f19a4c34d43c7c11f7cb084ff3db947cfa82d8d52fc94c112bb2a7R243-R247) property to the tool's `Feature` class. If a feature is on and has a `runtimeId`, its `runtimeId` will be [stamped into the Dart application as a Dart define](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168437/files#diff-bd662448bdc2e6f50e47cd3b20b22b41a828561bce65cb4d54ea4f5011cc604eR293-R327). The framework uses this Dart define to [determine which features are enabled](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168437/files#diff-c8dbd5cd3103bc5be53c4ac5be8bdb9bf73e10cd5d8e4ac34e737fd1f8602d45).  ### Multi-window example  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168697 shows how this new feature flag system can be used to add a multi-window feature flag:  1. It adds a new [multi-window feature](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168697/files#diff-0ded384225f19a4c34d43c7c11f7cb084ff3db947cfa82d8d52fc94c112bb2a7R189-R198) to the Flutter tool. This can be turned on using `flutter config --enable-multi-window` or by putting `enable-multi-window: true` in an app's .pubspec, under the `flutter` section. 2. It adds a new [`isMultiWindowEnabled`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168697/files#diff-c8dbd5cd3103bc5be53c4ac5be8bdb9bf73e10cd5d8e4ac34e737fd1f8602d45R7-R11) property to the framework. 3. The Material library can use this new property to determine whether it should create a new window. [Example](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168697/files#diff-2cbc1634ed6b61d61dfa090e7bfbbb7c60b74c8abc3a28df6f79eee691fd1b73).  ## Limitations  ### Tool and framework only  For now, these feature flags are available only to the Flutter tool and Flutter framework. The flags are not automatically available to the embedder or the engine.  For example, embedders need to configure their surfaces differently if Impeller is enabled. This configuration must happen before the Dart isolate is launched. As a result, the framework's feature flags is not a viable solution for this scenario for now. For these kinds of scenarios, we should continue to use platform-specific configuration like the `AndroidManifest.xml` or `Info.plist` files.  This is a fixable limitation, we just need to invest in this plumbing :)  ### Tree shaking  Feature flags are not designed to help tree shaking. For example, you cannot conditionally import Dart code depending on the enabled feature flags. Code that is feature flagged off will still be imported into user's apps.  ## Pre-launch Checklist  - [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs. - [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities. - [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement]. - [x] I signed the [CLA]. - [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above. - [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`). - [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt]. - [x] I followed the [breaking change policy] and added [Data Driven Fixes] where supported. - [x] All existing and new tests are passing.

The change ensures that the separator is now vertically centered, improving the overall UI alignment and consistency.  Previously, the separator used only the TextAlign.center property, which did not fully address the vertical alignment issue. The updated code wraps the separator text in a Center widget to ensure proper centering both horizontally and vertically.  Before:  The separator (:) was horizontally centered but not aligned vertically. After:  The separator is now both horizontally and vertically centered within the time picker.   ![image-20241023-041530](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8401264a-a751-47b4-b634-5742ba4fabcd) ![Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12 33 05](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab95abd9-8de8-4f7d-9114-d96073d8f887)  Issues Fixed This PR fixes issue https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/157402 (Vertical alignment issue in the time picker separator).  ---------  Co-authored-by: Mitchell Goodwin <58190796+MitchellGoodwin@users.noreply.github.com> Co-authored-by: Chris Bracken <chris@bracken.jp>",59,7,66

The listener intercepts screen reader activations (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS, etc.) and forces DOM focus on the activated elements, ensuring they integrate properly with Flutter's navigation focus restoration.  **Before** When using VoiceOver or other screen readers to navigate between pages in a Flutter web app, focus restoration would fail because assistive technology activations don't naturally trigger the DOM focus events that Flutter's navigation system expects. Users would lose their navigation context, with focus jumping to default elements instead of returning to the previously activated button.  **Before behavior demo** https://focus-demo-0529-before.web.app On mac os, Use command + F5 to activate voice over.  Use control + option + arrow right to focus on ""Go to page two"" button.  Use control + option +  space to click the ""Go to page two"" button.  Then in page two, use control + option + arrow right to focus on ""Back to page one"" button. The focus will be on ""Page one"" heading instead of ""Go to page two"" button. This is not expected  **After** Screen reader users can now navigate between pages and have their focus properly restored to the previously activated element (e.g., ""Go to Page Two"" button) when returning to a previous page, providing a consistent and accessible navigation experience across all assistive technologies.  **After behavior demo** https://focus-demo-0529-after.web.app On mac os, Use command + F5 to activate voice over.  Use control + option + arrow right to focus on ""Go to page two"" button.  Use control + option +  space to click the ""Go to page two"" button.  Then in page two, use control + option + arrow right to focus on ""Back to page one"" button. The focus will be on ""Go to page two"" button. This is expected.  **Issue Fixed** This PR addresses GitHub Issue #140483, which reports that VoiceOver focus restoration doesn't work in Flutter web applications during navigation.   ## Pre-launch Checklist  - [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs. - [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities. - [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement]. - [x] I signed the [CLA]. - [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above. - [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`). - [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt]. - [x] I followed the [breaking change policy] and added [Data Driven Fixes] where supported. - [x] All existing and new tests are passing.",474,26,500

Updates the existing `--minify` flag to pass its value to both JS and wasm (instead of just JS).  Also adds two new flags `--minify-js` and `--minify-wasm` which toggle minification for just one of the web targets. While JS minification has a huge impact on code size, wasm minification has a much smaller effect on the program's size. Since minification can obfuscate useful info (like errors) one may want to turn off minification for wasm but leave it on for JS.  The plan is to temporarily use `--no-minify-wasm` for devtools to help debug some exceptions being seen.  ---------  Co-authored-by: Nate Biggs <natebiggs@google.com>",213,74,287

flutter/flutter,94e97d9c1221747e1ef5d8648d8a01a72cee3b25,Loïc Sharma,2025-06-28T00:01:27Z,"Ensure disabling text fields' interactive selection disables shortcuts (#171050)  [`EditableText.enableInteractiveSelection`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/EditableText/enableInteractiveSelection.html) can be used to disable text selection and shortcuts in a text field.  Previously, `EditableText` would disable the shortcut actions using [`Action.isEnabled`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Action/isEnabled.html). As a result, the action would ignore the key event, and the key event would propagate. On some platforms, the key event would propagate to the native text view, causing weird behaviors like text getting copied.  Now, the text field shortcuts stop propagation of the key event when `enableInteractiveSelection` is `false`. This ensures that the text field ""consumes"" the key events and prevents a parent of the text field or native views from receiving the key event.  Partially addresses https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/157611  ⚠️ Note: This does not fix the bug on Flutter Web as it handles text field shortcuts separately. This will be fixed in a separate pull request.  ## Pre-launch Checklist  - [x] I read the [Contributor Guide] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs. - [x] I read the [Tree Hygiene] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities. - [x] I read and followed the [Flutter Style Guide], including [Features we expect every widget to implement]. - [x] I signed the [CLA]. - [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above. - [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`). - [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [test-exempt]. - [x] I followed the [breaking change policy] and added [Data Driven Fixes] where supported. - [x] All existing and new tests are passing.

The link appeared as `([flutter engine]https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine)` instead of proper markdown link syntax.  **Change Made**: Added the missing opening parenthesis to fix the markdown link: ```diff - * The Engine ([flutter engine]https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine) + * The Engine ([flutter engine](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine)) ```  **Impact**: This ensures developers reading the documentation can properly navigate to the Engine repository and that the markdown renders correctly across all platforms.  This fixes a documentation quality issue found during routine documentation review. While this doesn't correspond to a specific filed GitHub issue, it addresses a clear usability problem in the official Flutter documentation.  ## Pre-launch Checklist  - [x] I read the [[Contributor Guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md#overview)] and followed the process outlined there for submitting PRs. - [x] I read the [[Tree Hygiene](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md)] wiki page, which explains my responsibilities. - [x] I read and followed the [[Flutter Style Guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo.md)], including [[Features we expect every widget to implement](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo.md#features-we-expect-every-widget-to-implement)]. - [x] I signed the [[CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/)]. - [x] I listed at least one issue that this PR fixes in the description above. - [x] I updated/added relevant documentation (doc comments with `///`). - [x] I added new tests to check the change I am making, or this PR is [[test-exempt](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md#tests)]. - [x] I followed the [[breaking change policy](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md#handling-breaking-changes)] and added [[Data Driven Fixes](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Data-driven-Fixes.md)] where supported. - [x] All existing and new tests are passing.  **Note**: This PR is test-exempt as it only fixes a markdown syntax error in documentation.

Reviewers are typically assigned within a week of filing a request. To learn more about code review, see our documentation on Tree Hygiene: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md -->  This PR fixes an exception thrown when trying to update an unmounted PopupMenuButton's position, which can happen when a layout change is triggered during PopupMenuButton's pop animation (see issue's attached video). A workaround is to set `popUpAnimationStyle: AnimationStyle.noAnimation`. This PR fixes it by returning the last known position if the button is unmounted.

Reviewers are typically assigned within a week of filing a request. To learn more about code review, see our documentation on Tree Hygiene: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md -->  **Fix text selection toolbar alignment for RTL (right-to-left) languages**  This PR updates the Material text selection toolbar to properly support right-to-left (RTL) layouts. Previously, the toolbar and its buttons did not align or order correctly when using RTL text direction, leading to a broken or confusing user experience for RTL languages.  **Summary of changes:** - Refactored layout logic in `text_selection_toolbar.dart` to handle RTL and LTR directions for both horizontal and overflow (vertical) arrangements. - Updated padding logic in `text_selection_toolbar_text_button.dart` to use `EdgeInsetsDirectional`, ensuring correct padding for both text directions. - Added new widget tests to verify that:   - Toolbar items are ordered right-to-left in RTL contexts. - The overflow menu behaves correctly in RTL, showing items in the correct order and position.  **Before:**   - Toolbar items and overflow menus did not respect RTL layout, resulting in misaligned or reversed button order. - Padding was inconsistent in RTL. <details> <summary>Before Screenshots</summary>  | LTR Not Expanded | LTR Expanded | RTL Not Expanded | RTL Expanded | |---|---|---|---| | ![before_ltr_non_expanded jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bccf719e-c95a-46b1-b924-d2fb229e4ada) | ![before_ltr_expanded jpg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a947690a-62fb-4f41-863c-d3822294bb66) | ![before_rtl_non_expanded](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e3440ee-d80c-4554-aeda-7632f2b166ca) | ![before_rtl_expanded](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/364a3b2b-d068-4488-afbd-61224e74c30a) |  </details>   **After:**   - Toolbar items and overflow menus are correctly ordered and aligned for RTL. - Button padding is now directionally correct.  <details> <summary>After Screenshots</summary>  | LTR Not Expanded | LTR Expanded | RTL Not Expanded | RTL Expanded | |---|---|---|---| | ![after_ltr_non_expanded](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b63bf625-0d37-4304-9ba5-af017c197b15) | ![after_ltr_expanded](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a95c9b7-e343-4e7e-93ae-f18de6d38a2e) | ![after_rtl_not_expanded](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a93b08b-fcf2-45a9-8f5a-390133c0aec4) | ![after_rtl_expanded](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cbdffd4-3943-44cc-98d9-fa470e11b942) |  </details>  This improves the usability and accessibility of text selection controls for users of RTL languages.

If other parts of the Flutter framework want to use `package:meta`, they must do so through the `foundation` library by exporting the desired `package:meta` member. This requirement is enforced through `dev/bots/analyze.dart` [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/dev/bots/analyze.dart#L2749-L2750).  This exports the `internal` attribute so that it can be used by the Flutter framework. This change was split off from https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/168437 as it might cause problems in google3 if there is code that imports both `package:meta/meta.dart` and `package:flutter/foundation.dart`.

I didn't end up using Actions, mainly because nested behavior was unwieldy and capturing BuildContext has drawbacks. This uses a basic callback mechanism to animate the menu open and closed. Check out the examples.  <hr />  ### The problem RawMenuAnchor synchronously shows or hides an overlay menu in response to `MenuController.open()` and `MenuController.close`, respectively. Because animations cannot be run on a hidden overlay, there currently is no way for developers to add animations to RawMenuAnchor and its subclasses (MenuAnchor, DropdownMenuButton, etc).  ### The solution This PR: - Adds two callbacks -- `onOpenRequested` and `onCloseRequested` -- to RawMenuAnchor. - onOpenRequested is called with a position and a showOverlay callback, which opens the menu when called. - onCloseRequested is called with a hideOverlay callback, which hides the menu when called.  When `MenuController.open()` and `MenuController.close()` are called, onOpenRequested and onCloseRequested are invoked, respectively.

Key changes include the addition of a global setup for creating test users, new utilities for managing test user pools, and expanded test coverage for signup and authentication scenarios.  ### Testing Infrastructure Enhancements:  * **Global Setup for Tests**: - Added `globalSetup` in `playwright.config.ts` to create test users before all tests run. This ensures consistent test data across test suites. (`autogpt_platform/frontend/playwright.config.ts`, [autogpt_platform/frontend/playwright.config.tsR16-R17](diffhunk://#diff-27484f7f20f2eb1aeb289730a440f3a126fa825a7b3fae1f9ed19e217c4f2e40R16-R17)) - Implemented `global-setup.ts` to handle test user creation and save user pools to the file system. Includes fallback for reusing existing user pools if available. (`autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/global-setup.ts`, [autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/global-setup.tsR1-R43](diffhunk://#diff-3a8141beba2a6117e0eb721c35b39acc168a8f913ee625ce056c6fab5ac3b192R1-R43))  * **Test User Management Utilities**: - Added functions in `auth.ts` to create, save, load, and clean up test users. Supports batch creation and file-based persistence for user pools. (`autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/utils/auth.ts`, [autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/utils/auth.tsR1-R190](diffhunk://#diff-198b5d07aa72d50c153a70ecdfdc4bacc408c2d638c90d858f40d0183549973bR1-R190)) - Enhanced `user-generator.ts` to generate individual or multiple test users with customizable options. (`autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/utils/user-generator.ts`, [autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/utils/user-generator.tsR2-R41](diffhunk://#diff-a7cb4f403a4cf3605ed1046b0263412205e56e51b16052a9da1e8db9bf34b940R2-R41))  ### Expanded Test Coverage:  * **Signup Flow Tests**: - Added comprehensive tests for signup functionality, including successful signup, form validation, custom credentials, and duplicate email handling. (`autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/signup.spec.ts`, [autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/signup.spec.tsR1-R113](diffhunk://#diff-d1baa54deff7f3b1eedefd6cec5619ae8edd872d361ef57b6c32998ed22d6661R1-R113)) - Developed `signup.ts` utility functions to automate signup processes and validate form behavior. (`autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/utils/signup.ts`, [autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/utils/signup.tsR1-R184](diffhunk://#diff-cb05d73a6bd7a129759b0b3382825e90cde561a42fc85b6a25777f6bd2f84511R1-R184))  * **Authentication Utilities**: - Introduced `SigninUtils` in `signin.ts` for login, logout, and authentication cycle testing. Provides reusable methods for verifying user states. (`autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/utils/signin.ts`, [autogpt_platform/frontend/src/tests/utils/signin.tsR1-R94](diffhunk://#diff-7cfec955c159d69f51ba9fcca7d979be090acd6fe246b125551d60192d697d98R1-R94))  ### Minor Updates:  * Added environment variable `BROWSER_TYPE` to CI workflow for browser-specific Playwright tests. (`.github/workflows/platform-frontend-ci.yml`, [.github/workflows/platform-frontend-ci.ymlR215-R216](diffhunk://#diff-29396f5dccefac146b71bed295fdbb790b17fda6a5ce2e9f4f8abe80eb14a527R215-R216))  These changes collectively improve the robustness and maintainability of the frontend testing framework, enabling more reliable and scalable testing of user authentication features.  ### Checklist 📋  - [x] I have clearly listed my changes in the PR description - [x] I have made a test plan - [x] I have tested my changes according to the test plan:   - [x] Validated all authentication tests, and they are working",644,7,651

Previously, when users clicked email reset links, the Supabase client on the browser would automatically handle the code exchange, but with`httpOnly`, this is not possible because the Supabase browser client does not have access to session info, so it fails silently 🥵  ### Solution  Moved password reset code exchange to server-side middleware that can access `httpOnly` cookies and properly create authenticated sessions.  ### Code Changes  **`middleware.ts`** - intercepts `/reset-password` URLs containing `code` parameter - uses helper function to exchange code for session server-side - redirects with error parameters if exchange fails - moved `getUser()` call to avoid middleware timing issues  **`reset-password/page.tsx`** - added toast notifications for password reset errors - checks URL parameters for error messages on page load  ## Checklist 📋  ### For code changes: - [x] I have clearly listed my changes in the PR description - [x] I have made a test plan - [x] I have tested my changes according to the test plan:   - [x] Password reset emails send successfully   - [x] Valid reset codes exchange for sessions server-side   - [x] Invalid/expired codes show error messages via toast   - [x] Successfully authenticated users can change passwords   - [x] URL parameters are cleaned up after error display   - [x] Middleware doesn't break normal authentication flows     ### For configuration changes:  For this to work we need to configure Supabase with the new password-reset redirect URL. ``` /api/auth/callback/reset-password ``` - [x] Already added in Supabase dev - [ ] We need to add it on Supabase prod",106,10,116

That is because the `BackendAPI` was proxied via [server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) ( _to make calls to our Backend on the Next.js server_ ).  Looks like server actions don't run in parallel, and their performance is also subpar, given that we are not hosted on Vercel (they don't utilise the edge middleware).  These changes cause all `BackendAPI` calls to be proxied via the Next.js `/api/` route when executed on the browser; when executed on the server, they bypass the proxy and directly access the API. Hopefully we gain:  - 🚀 Better Performance - API routes are faster than server actions for this use case - 🔧 Less Magic - Direct fetch calls instead of hidden server action complexity - ♻️ Code Reuse - Leveraging the existing proxy infrastructure used by react-query - 🎯 Cleaner Architecture - Single proxy pattern for all API calls - 🔒 Same Security - Still uses server-side authentication with httpOnly cookies  ## Checklist 📋  ### For code changes: - [x] I have clearly listed my changes in the PR description - [x] I have made a test plan - [x] I have tested my changes according to the test plan:   - [x] E2E tests pass   - [x] Click through the app, there is no issues   - [x] Agent executions are fast again in the builder   - [x] Test file uploads",154,32,186

Tool shells    are included: we keep the envelope but shorten huge payloads. 2. **Middle-out deletion** – if still over the limit, delete the whole    messages working outward from the centre, **skipping** any message    that contains ``tool_calls`` or has ``role == ""tool""``. 3. **Last-chance trim** – if still too big, truncate the *first* and    *last* message bodies down to `floor_cap` tokens. 4.

Refreshing the page fixes it.  The problem was that `supabase.logOut()` is a client side action, and `<Navbar />` is a RSC who fetchs the session on the server to display the state and does not know on the client it was invalidated. `router.refresh()` solves the issue by forcing RSC on the page to refetch their state and update server side. Further reading [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#invalidation-1).  I also improved the UX awaiting the promise and displaying a spinner while the log out action is happening. If logout fails ( _should be very rare_ ) I'm displaying a toast to not let the user be hanging wondering what happened.  ### Checklist 📋  #### For code changes: - [x] I have clearly listed my changes in the PR description - [x] I have made a test plan - [x] I have tested my changes according to the test plan:   - [x] Login   - [x] Open account menu   - [x] Click `Logout`   - [x] I see a spinner while the action is happening - [x] I'm redirected to `/login` and I no longer see the account menu",45,10,55

The request could not be resolved by Node.js from the project directory. Packages that should be external need to be installed in the project directory, so they can be resolved from the output files. Try to install it into the project directory by running npm install import-in-the-middle from the project directory. ```  ### Why were the warnings happening?  The Sentry SDK for Next.js tries to hook into Node.js internals using packages like `import-in-the-middle` and `require-in-the-middle`. When Sentry is imported at the top level on a file (even if not enabled), it tries to load these dependencies... If they are not installed, then we get these warnings...  ### Why does installing the packages fix it?  By installing `import-in-the-middle` and `require-in-the-middle` as dev dependencies, Sentry finds them and the warnings disappear. This is a safe workaround for local/dev, and does not affect production.  ### Loading Sentry conditionally  One way to avoid these warnings ⚠️ is by loading Sentry conditionally. That is the approach I took in an earlier PR. However I realised that it would have to apply to any file importing Sentry: ```ts import * as Sentry from ""@sentry/nextjs""; ``` which would end quite messy and affecting a lot of files. I realised installing the packages is just simpler ( _they won't in the bundle or affect page load_ ) and using `enabled` in the Sentry initialisation is also cleaner.  ## Checklist 📋  ### For code changes: - [x] I have clearly listed my changes in the PR description - [x] I have made a test plan - [x] I have tested my changes according to the test plan: - [x] There are not Sentry warnings when running the local dev server ( with or without `--turbo` ) - [x] Sentry still reports issues in production or staging ( _but not locally_ )",78,57,135

It also includes corresponding snapshot files for these tests. Below are the most significant changes:  ### Documentation Updates: * Added a detailed `TESTING.md` file to the backend, providing a guide for running tests, snapshot testing, writing API route tests, and best practices. It includes examples for mocking, fixtures, and CI/CD integration.  ### Analytics Logging Tests: * Implemented tests for logging raw metrics and analytics in `analytics_test.py`, covering success scenarios, various input values, invalid requests, and complex nested data. These tests utilize snapshot testing for response validation. * Added snapshot files for analytics logging tests, including responses for success cases, various metric values, and complex analytics data.

Currently, we prevent this to avoid unexpected ordering of the execution.  ### Changes 🏗️  #### Executor changes  We decoupled the node execution output processing, which is responsible for deciding the next executions from the node executor code.  Currently, `execute_node` does two big things: * Runs the block’s execute(...) (which yields outputs). * immediately enqueues the next nodes based on those outputs.  This PR makes: * execute_node(node_exec) -> stream of (output_name, data). That purely runs the block and yields each output as soon as it’s available. * Move _enqueue_next_nodes into the graph executor. So the next execution is handled serially by the graph executor to avoid concurrency issues.  #### UI changes  The change on the executor also fixes the behavior of the execution update to the UI We will report the execution output to the UI as soon as it is available, not when the node execution is fully completed. This, however, broke the bread calculation logic that assumes each execution update will never overlap. So the change in this PR makes the bead calculation take the overlap / duplicated execution update into account, and simplify the overall calculation logic.   ### Checklist 📋  #### For code changes: - [x] I have clearly listed my changes in the PR description - [x] I have made a test plan - [x] I have tested my changes according to the test plan:   <!-- Put your test plan here: -->   - [x] Execute this agent and observe its concurrency ordering    <img width=""1424"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fe8259f-9091-4ecc-b824-ce8e8819c2d2"" />",331,163,494

The workflow listens for specific PR events and dispatches corresponding deployment/undeployment actions to our cloud infrastructure repository.  **How it works:** - The workflow triggers on PR events (opened, synchronized, closed) and PR target events (labeled, unlabeled) - When a PR comment containing `!deploy` is detected from authorized users (PR author, repo owners, members, or collaborators), it dispatches a deployment event - When a PR with existing deployments is closed, it automatically dispatches an undeployment event to clean up resources  **Interaction with target repository:** The workflow dispatches events to `Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT_cloud_infrastructure` with a payload containing: - `action`: Either ""deploy"" or ""undeploy"" - `pr_number`: The PR number for tracking - `pr_title`: Human-readable identifier - `pr_state`: Current PR state - `repo`: Source repository name  This enables the infrastructure repository to spin up isolated development environments for each PR on demand.  ### Changes 🏗️ - Added `.github/workflows/dev-deploy-pr-dispatcher.yml` workflow file - Implements secure cross-repository communication using repository dispatch events - Includes authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can trigger deployments  ### Checklist 📋  #### For code changes: - [x] No code changes - this is a workflow addition only  #### For configuration changes: - [x] New workflow file added that requires testing - [x] Requires `DISPATCH_TOKEN` secret to be configured with appropriate permissions for cross-repository dispatch - [x] No environment variable changes needed - [ ] Workflow will be tested after initial merge to verify proper event dispatching",307,38,345

Complex Filtering Query (19.3% of total time) ```sql SELECT ... FROM ""AgentNodeExecution""  WHERE ""agentNodeId"" = $1    AND ""agentGraphExecutionId"" = $2    AND ""executionStatus"" = $3    AND ""id"" NOT IN (     SELECT ""referencedByInputExecId""      FROM ""AgentNodeExecutionInputOutput""      WHERE ""name"" = $4 AND ""referencedByInputExecId"" IS NOT NULL   ) ORDER BY ""addedTime"" ASC ```  ### 2. Multi-table JOIN Query (8.9% of total time) ```sql SELECT ... FROM ""AgentNodeExecution""  LEFT JOIN ""AgentNode"" ON ... LEFT JOIN ""AgentBlock"" ON ... WHERE ""AgentBlock"".""id"" IN (...)    AND ""executionStatus"" != $11   AND ""agentGraphExecutionId"" IN (...) ORDER BY ""queuedTime"" DESC, ""addedTime"" DESC ```  ### 3. Bulk Graph Execution Queries (multiple variations, ~10% combined) Multiple queries filtering by `agentGraphExecutionId` with various ordering requirements.  ## Optimization Strategy  ### 1. Composite Indexes for AgentNodeExecution  Set the following composite indexes to the `AgentNodeExecution` model:  ```prisma @@index([agentGraphExecutionId, agentNodeId, executionStatus]) @@index([addedTime, queuedTime]) ```  #### Benefits: - **Index 1**: Covers the exact WHERE clause of the complex filtering query, allowing index-only scans - **Index 2**: Optimizes queries filtering by graph execution and status - **Index 3**: Supports efficient sorting when filtering by graph execution - **Index 4**: Optimizes ORDER BY operations on time fields  ### 2. Composite Index for AgentNodeExecutionInputOutput  Added the following composite index:  ```prisma   // Input and Output pin names are unique for each AgentNodeExecution.   @@unique([referencedByInputExecId, referencedByOutputExecId, name])   @@index([referencedByOutputExecId])   // Composite index for `upsert_execution_input`.   @@index([name, time]) ```  #### Benefits: - Dramatically improves the NOT IN subquery performance in Query 1 - Allows the database to use an index scan instead of a full table scan - Reduces the subquery execution time from O(n) to O(log n)  ## Expected Performance Improvements  1. **Query 1 (19.3% of total time)**:     - Expected improvement: 80-90% reduction in execution time - The composite index on `[agentNodeId, agentGraphExecutionId, executionStatus]` will allow index-only scans - The subquery will benefit from the new index on `AgentNodeExecutionInputOutput`  2. **Query 2 (8.9% of total time)**:    - Expected improvement: 50-70% reduction in execution time - The `[agentGraphExecutionId, executionStatus]` index will reduce the initial filtering cost  3. **Bulk Queries (10% combined)**:    - Expected improvement: 60-80% reduction in execution time - Composite indexes including time fields will optimize sorting operations  ## Migration Considerations  1. **Index Creation Time**: Creating these indexes on existing large tables may take time 2. **Storage Impact**: Each index requires additional storage space 3. **Write Performance**: Slight decrease in INSERT/UPDATE performance due to index maintenance   ## Additional Optimizations  ### NotificationEvent Table Index  Added index for notification batch queries:  ```prisma @@index([userNotificationBatchId]) ```  This optimizes the query: ```sql SELECT ... FROM ""NotificationEvent""  WHERE ""userNotificationBatchId"" IN (...) ```  #### Benefits: - Eliminates full table scans when filtering by batch ID - Improves query performance from O(n) to O(log n) - Particularly beneficial for users with many notification events  ## Future Optimizations  Consider these additional optimizations if needed: 1. Partitioning `AgentNodeExecution` table by `createdAt` or `agentGraphExecutionId` 2. Implementing materialized views for frequently accessed aggregate data 3. Adding covering indexes for specific query patterns 4. Implementing query result caching at the application level  ---------  Co-authored-by: Zamil Majdy <zamil.majdy@agpt.co>",43,9,52

This PR was automatically generated by Autofix 🤖  This fix was triggered by Toran Bruce Richards.  Fixes [AUTOGPT-SERVER-1ZY](https://sentry.io/organizations/significant-gravitas/issues/6386687527/). The issue was that: `llm_call` calculates `max_tokens` without considering `input_tokens`, causing OpenRouter API errors when the context window is exceeded.  - Implements a function `estimate_token_count` to estimate the number of tokens in a list of messages. - Calculates available tokens based on the context window, estimated input tokens, and user-defined max tokens. - Adjusts `max_tokens` for LLM calls to prevent exceeding context window limits. - Reduces `max_tokens` by 15% and retries if a token limit error is encountered during LLM calls.  If you have any questions or feedback for the Sentry team about this fix, please email [autofix@sentry.io](mailto:autofix@sentry.io) with the Run ID: 32838.  ---------  Co-authored-by: sentry-autofix[bot] <157164994+sentry-autofix[bot]@users.noreply.github.com> Co-authored-by: Krzysztof Czerwinski <kpczerwinski@gmail.com>",26,1,27

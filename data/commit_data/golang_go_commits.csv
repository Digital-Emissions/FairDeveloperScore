golang/go,1e48ca7020adf13e0fa4a6c2053f210b869bfa24,Joe Tsai,2025-07-10T00:08:49Z,"encoding/json: remove legacy option to EscapeInvalidUTF8  In the presence of invalid UTF-8, the AllowInvalidUTF8 option allows such bytes to be present, but silently mangles them using the Unicode replacement character.  The v2 default is to emit the replacement character verbatim (which is valid UTF-8 and exactly what it is for).  However, the v1 behavior has historically been to emit the escaped form of the replacement character. This behavior was introduced in https://go.dev/cl/11211045 where the documentation says that it is:      replacing invalid bytes with the Unicode replacement rune U+FFFD  but the implementation actually replaces it with the escaped form of the Unicode replacement rune. Given that the documentation differs from the implementation, the actual behavior is likely an oversight.  Given how esoteric of behavior this is, we change the v1in2 behavior to avoid the unnecesary escaping and drop support for EscapeInvalidUTF8.  This does not violate the Go compatibility agreement since we do not document what the exact syntactic output is. Also, there has already been prior precedence for changing the output:  * [encoding/json: encode \b and \f as '\b' and '\f' in JSON strings](https://go.dev/cl/521675) * [encoding/json: encode \n in strings as ""\n"", not ""\u000A""](https://go.dev/cl/4678046) * [encoding/json: encode \t as \t instead of \u0009](https://go.dev/cl/162340043) * [encoding/json: use standard ES6 formatting for numbers during marshal](https://go.dev/cl/30371)  Fixes #74551  Change-Id: Ib59a873c44713d302f1f6ab103ffba2520d63276 Reviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/687116 Auto-Submit: Joseph Tsai <joetsai@digital-static.net> LUCI-TryBot-Result: Go LUCI <golang-scoped@luci-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com> Reviewed-by: Damien Neil <dneil@google.com> Reviewed-by: Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn <johan.brandhorst@gmail.com> Reviewed-by: Carlos Amedee <carlos@golang.org>",9,33,42

The logic in unmarshalFull simply casted io.EOF as io.ErrUnexpectedEOF, which is inconsistent with how all other io.ErrUnexpectedEOF are reported, which are wrapped within a jsontext.SyntacticError. Do the same thing for consistency.  We add a v1 test (without goexperiment.jsonv2) to verify that the behavior is identical to how v1 has always behaved.  We add a v1in2 test (with goexperiment.jsonv2) to verify that the v1in2 behavior correctly replicates historical v1 behavior.  We also fix a faulty check in v1 Decoder.Decode, where it tried to detect errUnexpectedEnd and return an unwrapped io.ErrUnexpectedEOF error. This is the exact semantic that v1 has always done in streaming Decoder.Decode (but not non-streaming Unmarshal). There is a prior bug reported in #25956 about this inconsistency, but we aim to preserve historical v1 behavior to reduce the probability of churn when v1 is re-implemented in terms of v2.

See #67043 (which focuses on the inverse, recovering signatures by controlling the public key input to Verify), and in particular https://github.com/golang/go/issues/67043#issuecomment-2079335804.  Stopping the Verify adaptive attack would require significantly more complexity, the kind that has caused vulnerabilities in the past (e.g. CVE-2016-2107). On the other hand, assuming that a public key is confidential is unlikely to work in practice, since it can be recovered from just two valid (message, signature) pairs.

Now that CL 684116 is merged, we should no longer disable these optimizations when coverage is enabled, which is what this CL does.

As expected, if we place this CL just before the necessary fix in CL 684116, the cover_build_pkg_select.txt testscript fails with a changed coverage result.

Doing this requires a few categories of config changes:  * ignoring a few new tests for features crypto/tls doesn't implement * ignoring a few new tests that require further   investigation/classification, or that already have an associated   tracking issue * updating the error map syntax to accommodate the upstream change that   allows a one-to-many mapping  One code change is required in the shim test process to adjust how we tear down a connection after an error to account for an upstream change in the test runner.  Previously, for error conditions we would immediately close the connection when exiting the shim process. We instead need to do this in a multi-step process:  1. Flush any pending TLS writes to surface any alerts the error    condition may have generated. 2. Close the write side of the TCP connection to signal we're not    writing anymore. 3. Read and discard any pending data from the peer. 4. Close the read side of the TCP connection to fully close the socket.  Without doing this unpredictable timing factors may result in spurious test failures where:  1. The runner sends us data that produces an error. 2. We send an alert, and immediately tear down the connection. 3. The runner tries to perform a write, and hits an error because the    pipe is closed. 4. The runner fails the test with the pipe write error, before it reads    from the connection to see the expected alert.  With the new code we instead swallow the unrelated writes and the runner sees our alert after its ignored write when it tries to read from the conn. The alert is the expected test outcome, and so the test passes.  This was previously not an issue because the runner was discarding the write errors.

Unfortunately, growing allp is problematic. If procresize grows the allp backing array, it drops the reference to the old array. allpSnapshot still refers to the old array, but allpSnapshot is on the system stack in findRunnable, which also likely no longer has a P at all.  This means that a future GC will not find the reference and can free the array and use it for another allocation. This would corrupt later reads that findRunnable does from the array.  The fix is simple: the M struct itself is reachable by the GC, so we can stash the snapshot in the M to ensure it is visible to the GC.  The ugliest part of the CL is the cleanup when we are done with the snapshot because there are so many return/goto top sites. I am tempted to put mp.clearAllpSnapshot() in the caller and at top to make this less error prone, at the expensive of extra unnecessary writes.  Fixes #74414.

In this case, if the BSS reference has a larger size, we error out, because it is not safe to access a smaller symbol as if it has a larger size.  Sometimes code declares a global variable in Go and defines it in assembly with content. They are expected to be of the same size. However, in ASAN mode, we insert a red zone for the variable on the Go side, making it have a larger size, whereas the assembly symbol is unchanged. This causes the Go reference (BSS) has a larger size than the assembly definition (DATA). It results in an error currently. This code is valid and safe, so we should permit that.  We support this case by increasing the symbol size to match the larger size (of the BSS side). The symbol content (from the DATA side) is kept. In some sense, we merge the two symbols. When loading symbols, it is not easy to change its size (as the object file may be mapped read-only), so we add it to a fixup list, and fix it up later after all Go symbols are loaded. This is a very rare case, so the list should not be long.  We could limit this to just ASAN mode. But it seems okay to allow this in general. As long as the symbol has the larger size, it is safe to access it with the larger size.  Fixes #74314.

The root cause is page mapping churn. The Green Tea code introduced a new implicit nil check on value in a freshly-allocated span to clear some new heap metadata. This nil check would read the fresh memory, causing Linux to back that virtual address space with an RO page. This would then be almost immediately written to, causing Linux to possibly flush the TLB and find memory to replace that read-only page (likely deduplicated as just the zero page).  This CL fixes the issue by replacing the implicit nil check, which is a memory read expected to fault if it's truly nil, with an explicit one. The explicit nil check is a branch, and thus makes no reads to memory. The result is that the hugo binary no longer gets slower.  No regression test because it doesn't seem possible without access to OS internals, like Linux tracepoints. We briefly experimented with RSS metrics, but they're inconsistent. Some system RSS metrics count the deduplicated zero page, while others (like those produced by /proc/self/smaps) do not.  Instead, we'll add a new benchmark to our benchmark suite, separately.

Regardless of the default, it seems clear that we should at least support ISO 8601 if specified via a format flag. Note that this CL does not alter the default representation.  Unfortunately, ISO 8601 is a large and evolving standard with many optional extensions and optional restrictions. Thus, the term ""ISO 8601 duration"" unfortunately does not resolve to a particular grammar, nor one that is stable.  However, there is precedence that we can follow in this matter. JSON finds its heritage in JavaScript and JavaScript is adding a Temporal.Duration type whose default JSON representation is ISO 8601. There is a well-specified grammar for their particular profile of ISO 8601, which is documented at:     https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/#prod-Duration  This particular CL adds support for ISO 8601 according to the exact same grammar that JavaScript uses. While Temporal.Duration is technically still a proposal, it is already in stage 3 of the TC39 proposal process (i.e., ""no changes to the proposal are expected"" and ""has been recommended for implementation"") and therefore close to final adoption.  One major concern with ISO 8601 is that it supports nominal date units like years, months, weeks, and days that do not have an accurate meaning without being anchored to a particular point in time and place on Earth.  Fortunately, JavaScript (by default) avoids producing Temporal.Duration values with nominal units unless arithmetic in JavaScript explicitly sets a largestUnits value that is larger than ""hours"". In the Go implementation, we support syntactically parsing the full ISO 8601 grammar (according to JavaScript), but semantically report an error if nominal units are present. This ensures that ISO 8601 durations remain accurate so long as they only use the accurate units of hours, minutes, or seconds.

The problem isn't the GC persay, it's consistently correlated with a high STW time (likely a high 'stopping' time, not a 'stopped' time), suggesting that in the window of time when the garbage collector is trying to stop all goroutines, they continue to allocate.  This should probably be fixed in general, but for now, let's focus on this flaky test.  This CL changes the gc-stress test to (1) set a memory limit and (2) do more work in between allocations. (2) is really what makes things less flaky, but (2) unfortunately also means the GC is less exercised. That's where (1) comes in. By setting a low memory limit, we increase GC activity (in particular, assist activity). The memory limit also helps prevent the heap from totally blowing up due to the heap goal inflating from floating garbage, but it's not perfect.  After this change, under stress2, this test exceeds a heap size of 500 MiB only 1 in 5000 runs on my 64-vCPU VM. Before this change, it got that big about 1/4th of the time.  Fixes #74052.

But the limit field is load-bearing, because it's checked to filter out invalid pointers. A stale limit value could cause a crash by having the conservative scanner access allocBits out of bounds.  Fix this by setting the mspan limit field before publishing the span. For large objects and arena chunks, we adjust the limit down after allocSpan because we don't have access to the true object's size from allocSpan. However this is safe, since we first initialize the limit to something definitely safe (the actual span bounds) and only adjust it down after. Adjusting it down has the benefit of more precise debug output, but the window in which it's imprecise is also fine because a single object (logically, with arena chunks) occupies the whole span, so the 'invalid' part of the memory will just safely point back to that object. We can't do this for smaller objects because the limit will include space that does *not* contain any valid objects.  Fixes #74288.

This historically was only necessary if we weren't stopping the world to change the GC phase, because what we were worried about was mutual deadlock with mark workers' use of suspendG. And, they were the only users of suspendG.  In Go 1.22 this changed. The execution tracer began using suspendG, too. This leads to the possibility of mutual deadlock between the execution tracer and a goroutine trying to start or end the GC mark phase. The fix is simple: make the stop-the-world calls for the GC also call casGToWaitingForGC. This way, suspendG is guaranteed to make progress in this circumstance, and once it completes, the stop-the-world can complete as well.  We can take this a step further, though, and move casGToWaitingForGC into stopTheWorldWithSema, since there's no longer really a place we can afford to skip this detail.  While we're here, rename casGToWaitingForGC to casGToWaitingForSuspendG, since the GC is now not the only potential source of mutual deadlock.  Fixes #72740.

The first condition, checking whether the reader gen and the flushed gen match, should be sufficient to ensure the reader wakes up and finishes flushing all buffers. The first condition is also safe because it guarantees progress. In the case of shutdown, all the trace work that will be flushed has been flushed, and so the trace reader will exit into a regular goroutine context when it's finished. If not shutting down, then the trace reader will release doneSema, increase readerGen, and then the gopark unlockf will let it block until new work actually comes in.  Fixes #74045.

In goroutine profiles, it was handled explicitly. It's status would be checked during the first STW, and its stack would be recorded. This let the goroutine profiler completely ignore system goroutines once the world was started again.  CL 650697 added dedicated cleanup goroutines (there may be more than one), and with this, the logic for finalizer goroutines no longer scaled. In that CL, I let the isSystemGoroutine check be dynamic and dropped the special case, but this was based on incorrect assumptions. Namely, it's possible for the scheduler to observe, for example, the finalizer goroutine as a system goroutine and ignore it, but then later the goroutine profiler itself sees it as a user goroutine. At that point it's too late and already running. This violates the invariant of the goroutine profile that all goroutines are handled by the profiler before they start executing. In practice, the result is that the goroutine profiler can crash when it checks this invariant (not checking the invariant means racily reading goroutine stack memory).  The root cause of the problem is that these system goroutines do not participate in the goroutine profiler's state machine. Normally, when profiling, goroutines transition from 'absent' to 'in-progress' to 'satisfied'. However with system goroutines, the state machine is ignored entirely. They always stay in the 'absent' state. This means that if a goroutine transitions from system to user, it is eligible for a profile record when it shouldn't be. That transition shouldn't be allowed to occur with respect to the goroutine profiler, because the goroutine profiler is trying to snapshot the state of every goroutine.  The fix to this problem is simple: don't ignore system goroutines. Let them participate in the goroutine profile state machine. Instead, decide whether or not to record the stack after the goroutine has been acquired for goroutine profiling. This means if the scheduler observes the finalizer goroutine as a system goroutine, it will get promoted in the goroutine profiler's state machine, and no other part of the goroutine profiler will observe the goroutine again. Simultaneously, the stack record for the goroutine will be correctly skipped.  Fixes #74090.

When asynctimerchan=0 (the default), regular timers with an associated channel are only added to a timer heap when some channel operation is blocked on that channel. This allows us to garbage collect unreferenced, unstopped timers. Timers in a synctest bubble, in contrast, are always added to the bubble's timer heap.  This CL changes bubbled timers with a channel to be handled the same as unbubbled ones, adding them to the bubble's timer heap only when some channel operation is blocked on the timer's channel. This permits unstopped bubbled timers to be garbage collected, but more importantly it makes all timers past their deadline behave identically, regardless of whether they are in a bubble.  This CL also changes timer scheduling to execute bubbled timers immediately when possible rather than adding them to a heap. Timers in a bubble's heap are executed when the bubble is idle. Executing timers immediately avoids creating a predictable order of execution.

One is for ptrBuf, but on platforms other than Windows it doesn't actually cost anything due to demand-paging (Windows also demand-pages, but the memory is 'committed' so it still counts against OS RSS metrics). The other is for per-sizeclass scan stats. However when greenteagc is disabled, most of these scan stats are completely unused.  The worst-case memory overhead from these two sources is relatively small (about 10 KiB per P), but for programs with a small memory footprint running on a machine with a lot of cores, this can be significant (single-digit percent).  This change does two things. First, it puts ptrBuf initialization behind the greenteagc experiment, so now that memory is never allocated by default. Second, it abstracts the implementation details of scan stat collection and emission, such that we can have two different implementations depending on the build tag. This lets us remove all the unused stats when the greenteagc experiment is disabled, reducing the memory overhead of the stats from ~2.6 KiB per P to 536 bytes per P. This is enough to make the difference no longer noticable in our benchmark suite.  Fixes #73931.

Invoke the cmd/doc code directly by the go command instead of starting the doc tool in a separate process so we can preserve that property.  This change moves most of the doc code into the package cmd/internal/doc, and exposes a Main function from that function that's called both by the cmd/doc package, and by go doc.  This change makes couple of additional changes to intergrate doc into the go command:  The counter.Open call and the increment of invocations counter are only needed by cmd/doc. The go command will open the counters file and increment a counter for the doc subcommand.  We add a cmd_go_bootstrap tagged variant of the file that defines go doc so that we don't end up linking net into the bootstrap version of the go command. We don't need doc in that version of the command.  We create a new flagSet rather than using flag.CommandLine because when running as part of the go command, the flags to ""go doc"" won't be the top level flags.

We need to call SetGOROOT in ForceHost to re-set the GOROOT on the new context.  This was uncovered by CL 677558 because a go command that was built with trimpath would try to use its runtime.GOROOT(), which wouldn't be valid in trimpath mode.

This makes a sequence of insertions using AddExistingFiles much more efficient: creating a FileSet of size n by a sequence of calls costs O(n log n), whereas before it was O(n^2 log n) because of the repeated sorting.  The AVL tree is based on Russ' github.com/rsc/omap, simplified for clarity and to reduce unnecessary dynamism. We use an AVL tree as it is more strongly balanced than an RB tree, optimising lookups at the expense of insertions.  The CL includes a basic unit test of the tree using operations on pseudorandom values.  Benchmarks of Position lookups actually improve because the tree avoids BinarySearchFunc's dynamic dispatch to cmp, and the benchmark of AddExistingFiles is about 1000x (!) faster:  goos: darwin goarch: arm64 pkg: go/token cpu: Apple M1 Pro                                     │     old.txt     │               new.txt               │                                     │     sec/op      │    sec/op     vs base               │ FileSet_Position/random-8                51.60n ±  1%   39.99n ±  1%  -22.50% (p=0.000 n=9) FileSet_Position/file-8                  27.10n ±  3%   26.64n ±  1%        ~ (p=0.168 n=9) FileSet_Position/manyfiles-8             209.9n ± 17%   154.1n ±  9%  -26.58% (p=0.000 n=9) FileSet_AddExistingFiles/sequence-8   395930.3µ ±  4%   280.8µ ± 10%  -99.93% (p=0.000 n=9)  Updates #73205  Change-Id: Iea59c624a6cedadc2673987a5eb0ebece67af9e9 Reviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/675736 Reviewed-by: Robert Findley <rfindley@google.com> LUCI-TryBot-Result: Go LUCI <golang-scoped@luci-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com>",539,94,633

This is easily achieved by having the update goroutine double-check that updates are still allowed during STW before committing the new value.  However, it is possible for sysmon to concurrently run defaultGOMAXPROCS to compute a new GOMAXPROCS value after GOMAXPROCS returns. This new value will be discarded later, but we'll still perform the system calls necessary to compute the new value.  Normally this distinction doesn't matter, but if you want to sandbox a Go program, then you may want to disable GOMAXPROCS updates to reduce the system call footprint. A call to GOMAXPROCS will disable updates, but without a guarantee on when sysmon will observe the change it is somewhat fragile.  Add explicit synchronization between GOMAXPROCS and sysmon to guarantee that sysmon won't run defaultGOMAXPROCS after GOMAXPROCS returns.  The synchronization is a bit complex because we can't hold a mutex across STW, nor take a semaphore from sysmon, but the result isn't too bad.  One oddity is that sched.customGOMAXPROCS and gomaxprocs are no longer updated in lockstep (even though both are protected by sched.lock), but I don't believe anything should depend on that.

Theoretically we should run the entire update system in a dry run mode, and only bail out right before committing updates. But that is an awful lot of effort for a feature that is disabled. Plus some users (like sandboxes) want to completely disable the update syscalls (sched_getaffinity and pread64).

I have not yet come across a repro on arm64, but might as well be safe here.  The only real situation this could happen is when duffzero or duffcopy is passed a nil pointer. So we can just avoid the problem by doing the nil check outside duffzero/duffcopy. That way we never add a frame below duffzero/duffcopy. (Most other ways to get a new frame below the current one, like async preempt or debugger-generated calls, don't apply to duffzero/duffcopy because they are runtime functions; we're not allowed to preempt there.)

We also made it emit an error in the case that there are a contentless declaration of a larger size and a definition with content of a smaller size. In this case, we should choose the definition with content, but the code accesses it through the declaration of the larger size could fall into the next symbol, potentially causing data corruption. So we disallowed it.  There is one spcial case, though, that some code uses a linknamed variable declaration to reference a function in assembly, in order to take its address. The variable is often declared as uintptr. The function symbol is the definition, which could sometimes be shorter. This would trigger the error case above, causing existing code failing to build.  This CL allows it as a special case. It is still not safe to access the variable's content. But it is actually okay to just take its address, which the existing code often do.  Fixes #73617.

The work pattern is new in Go 1.25 and evaluates to the packages in the work (also called main) modules. 'go get work' would cause a panic because 'work' would be incorrectly considered a path pattern and then queryPath would would try to query a metapackage pattern (resulting in the internal error panic). This change properly supports the work pattern in go get.  It's pretty simple: First, we need to seprate the work pattern from the other patterns. Then in performWorkQueries, which maps queries to the modules that satisfy them, we return the single main module because by definition the work pattern is the set of packages in the work modules, and go get always runs in single module mode. (The exception is when the work module contains no packages, in which case we report a warning, and return no candidates because nothing is needed to resolve nothing).  The rest of the work is already done by loading the packages matching the query and finding missing imports in the call to findAndUpgradeImports in runGet.

This CL makes some small improvements to the escape analysis logging.  Here is a sample snippet of the current -m=2 logs:  ./print.go:587:7: parameter p leaks to {heap} with derefs=0: ./print.go:587:7:   flow: p = p: ./print.go:587:7:     from (*pp).printArg(p, err, 'v') (call parameter) at ./print.go:613:13 ./print.go:587:7:   flow: p = p: ./print.go:587:7:     from (*pp).handleMethods(p, verb) (call parameter) at ./print.go:749:22 [..]  If we attempt to tease apart some reasons why the -m=2 logs can be challenging to understand for the uninitiated:  - The ""flow"" lines are very useful, but contain more-or-less abstracted pseudocode. The ""from"" lines most often use actual code. When first looking at the logs, that distinction might not be apparent, which can result in looking back to the original code to hunt for pseudocode that doesn't exist there. (The log example shows 'p = p', but there is no 'p = p' in the original source).  - Escape analysis can be most interesting with inlining, but that can result in seeing overlapping short variable names (e.g., p, b, v...).  - The directionality of the ""flow"" lines might not be obvious, including whether they build top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top.  - The use of '{' and '}' in the -m=2 logs somewhat intersects with Go literals (e.g., if the log says ""{temp}"", an initial thought might be that represents some temp inside of some Go literal).  - And of course, escape analysis itself is subtle.  This CL:  - Adds the function name to the first -m=2 line to provide more context and reduce how often the reader needs to lookup line numbers.  - Uses the Unicode left arrow '←' rather than '=' on the flow lines to make it clearer that these lines are abstracted away from the original Go code and to help the directionality jump out.  In the future, we can consider changing ""{heap}"", ""{temp}"", ""{storage for foo}"" to something else, but we leave them as is for now.  Two examples with the modifications:  ./f1.go:3:9: parameter inptr leaks to outptr for func1 with derefs=0: ./f1.go:3:9:   flow: localptr ← inptr: ./f1.go:3:9:     from localptr := inptr (assign) at ./f1.go:4:11 ./f1.go:3:9:   flow: outptr ← localptr: ./f1.go:3:9:     from return localptr (return) at ./f1.go:5:2  ./b.go:14:20: []byte{...} escapes to heap in byteOrderExample: ./b.go:14:20:   flow: b ← &{storage for []byte{...}}: ./b.go:14:20:     from []byte{...} (spill) at ./byteorder.go:14:20 ./b.go:14:20:     from b := []byte{...} (assign) at ./byteorder.go:14:11 ./b.go:14:20:   flow: <heap> ← b: ./b.go:14:20:     from byteOrder.Uint32(b) (call parameter) at ./byteorder.go:15:32  These changes only affect the -m=2 output and leave the -m=1 output as is.

Flight recording is a technique in which trace data is kept in a circular buffer and can be flushed upon request. The implementation will be added in follow-up CLs.  The flight recorder has already been implemented inside of the golang.org/x/exp/trace package. This copies the current implementation and modifies it to work within the runtime/trace package.  The changes include:  This adds the ability for multiple consumers (both the execution tracer and the flight recorder) to subscribe to tracing events. This change allows us to add multiple consumers without making major modifications to the runtime. Future optimizations are planned for this functionality.  This removes the use of byte readers from the process that parses and processes the trace batches.  This modifies the flight recorder to not parse out the trace clock frequency, since that requires knowledge of the format that's unfortunate to encode in yet another place. Right now, the trace clock frequency is considered stable for the lifetime of the program, so just grab it directly from the runtime.  This change adds an in-band end-of-generation signal to the internal implementation of runtime.ReadTrace. The internal implementation is exported via linkname to runtime/trace, so the flight recorder can identify exactly when a generation has ended. This signal is also useful for ensuring that subscribers to runtime trace data always see complete generations, by starting or stopping data streaming only at generation boundaries.

This commit changes to use a decode_error alert for this condition instead.  The usage-pattern of the handshakeMessage interface is that we switch on the message type, invoke a specific concrete handshakeMessage type's unmarshal function, and then return it to the caller on success. At this point the caller looks at the message type and can determine if the message was unexpected or not. If it was unexpected, the call-sites emit the correct error for that case. Only the caller knows the current protocol state and allowed message types, not the generic handshake decoding logic.  With the above in mind, if we find that within the unmarshal logic for a specific message type that the data we have in hand doesn't match the protocol syntax we should emit a decode_error. An unexpected_message error isn't appropriate because we don't yet know if the message is unexpected or not, only that the message can't be decoded based on the spec's syntax for the type the message claimed to be.  Notably one unit test, TestQUICPostHandshakeKeyUpdate, had to have its test data adjusted because it was previously not testing the right thing: it was double-encoding the type & length prefix data for a key update message and expecting the QUIC logic to reject it as an inappropriate post-handshake message. In reality it was being rejected sooner as an invalid key update message from the double-encoding and this was masked by the previous alert for this condition matching the expected alert.  Finally, changing our alert allows enabling a handful of BoGo tests related to duplicate extensions of the form ""DuplicateExtension[Server|Client]-TLS-[TLS1|TLS11|TLS12|TLS13]"". One test remains skipped (DuplicateExtensionClient-TLS-TLS13), as it requires additional follow-up.

In some cases, there are execution-time performance benefits to point to runtime.zeroVal in particular. In reflect, pointer checks against the runtime.zeroVal memory address are used to side-step some work, such as in reflect.Value.Set and reflect.Value.IsZero.  In this CL, we therefore dig up the zeroVal symbol, and we use the machinery from earlier in our stack to use a pointer to zeroVal for the interface data pointer if we see examples like:      sink = S{} or:     s := S{}     sink = s  CL 649076 (also earlier in our stack) added most of the tests along with debug diagnostics in convert.go to make it easier to test this change.

This CL extends that to struct and array literals as well by creating read-only global storage that is able to represent for example S{1, 1}, and then using a pointer to that storage in the interface when the interface conversion happens.  A more challenging example is:      func example2() {         v := S{1, 1}         sink = v     }  In this case, the struct literal is not directly part of the interface conversion, but is instead assigned to a local variable.  To still avoid heap allocation in cases like this, in walk we construct a cache that maps from expressions used in interface conversions to earlier expressions that can be used to represent the same value (via ir.ReassignOracle.StaticValue). This is somewhat analogous to how we avoided heap allocation for basic literals in CL 649077 earlier in our stack, though here we also need to do a little more work to create the read-only global.

In the first example, that optimization is currently thwarted by the literal getting assigned to a local variable prior to use in the interface conversion.  This CL propagates constants to interface conversions like in the first example to avoid heap allocations, instead using a read-only global. The net effect is roughly turning the first example into the second.  One place this comes up in practice currently is with logging or debug prints. For example, if we have something like:     func conditionalDebugf(format string, args ...interface{}) {    	if debugEnabled {    		fmt.Fprintf(io.Discard, format, args...)    	}    }  Prior to this CL, this integer is heap allocated, even when the debugEnabled flag is false, and even when the compiler inlines conditionalDebugf:     v := 1000    conditionalDebugf(""hello %d"", v)  With this CL, the integer here is no longer heap allocated, even when the debugEnabled flag is enabled, because the compiler can now see that it can use a read-only global.

On Linux, containermaxprocs makes the Go runtime consider cgroup CPU bandwidth limits (quota/period) when setting GOMAXPROCS. If the cgroup limit is lower than the number of logical CPUs available, then the cgroup limit takes precedence.  On all OSes, updatemaxprocs makes the Go runtime periodically recalculate the default GOMAXPROCS value and update GOMAXPROCS if it has changed. If GOMAXPROCS is set manually, this update does not occur. This is intended primarily to detect changes to cgroup limits, but it applies on all OSes because the CPU affinity mask can change as well.  The runtime only considers the limit in the leaf cgroup (the one that actually contains the process), caching the CPU limit file descriptor(s), which are periodically reread for updates. This is a small departure from the original proposed design. It will not consider limits of parent cgroups (which may be lower than the leaf), and it will not detection cgroup migration after process start.  We can consider changing this in the future, but the simpler approach is less invasive; less risk to packages that have some awareness of runtime internals. e.g., if the runtime periodically opens new files during execution, file descriptor leak detection is difficult to implement in a stable way.

This allows for Go binaries to be run under Valgrind without emitting spurious errors.  Instead of adding the Valgrind headers to the tree, and using cgo to call the various Valgrind client request macros, we just add an assembly function which emits the necessary instructions to trigger client requests.  In particular we add instrumentation of the memory allocator, using a two-level mempool structure (as described in the Valgrind manual [0]). We also add annotations which allow Valgrind to track which memory we use for stacks, which seems necessary to let it properly function.  We describe the memory model to Valgrind as follows: we treat heap arenas as a ""pool"" created with VALGRIND_CREATE_MEMPOOL_EXT (so that we can use VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_METAPOOL and VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_AUTO_FREE). Within the pool we treat spans as ""superblocks"", annotated with VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_ALLOC. We then allocate individual objects within spans with VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK.  It should be noted that running binaries under Valgrind can be _quite slow_, and certain operations, such as running the GC, can be _very slow_. It is recommended to run programs with GOGC=off. Additionally, async preemption should be turned off, since it'll cause strange behavior (GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1).  Running Valgrind with --leak-check=yes will result in some errors resulting from some things not being marked fully free'd. These likely need more annotations to rectify, but for now it is recommended to run with --leak-check=off.

However, what it does is insufficient, because it could get unlucky and have the last object allocated be the first object of a new block.  This change changes the test to guarantee that a tiny object is not at the start of a fresh block by looking at the alignment of the object's pointer. If the object's pointer is odd, then that's good enough to know that it shares a block with something else, since the blocks themselves are aligned to a much higher power of two.  This fixes a failure I've seen on the builders.  Fixes #73810.

This is inconsistent with the argument ordering we use for 3 argument vector instructions, in which the argument order, as given in the RISC-V specifications, is reversed, and also with the vector FMA instructions which have the same argument ordering as the vector integer multiply add instructions in the ""The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume I"".
